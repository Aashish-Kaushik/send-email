# Node Project - Readme

This readme file provides an overview of the Node project, including the technologies used, project structure, and instructions for setup and deployment.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: Used for creating the frontend structure and user interface.
- Bootstrap: Utilized for styling and responsive design of the web application.
- Node.js: Serves as the backend technology for handling server-side logic and APIs.
- Nodemailer: Used as a service for sending emails from the application.

## Project Structure
The project follows a typical structure for a Node.js application. Here's an overview of the main directories and files:

```
- app.js: The main entry point of the application.
- controller/: Contains mail send functions.
- routes/: Defines the API routes and controllers for handling server-side logic.
- views/: Contains the HTML templates for rendering the frontend views.
- package.json: The configuration file that lists the project dependencies and scripts.
```

## Setup Instructions
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from (https://github.com/Aashish-Kaushik/send-email)
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Configure the necessary environment variables. These may include database credentials, API keys, and Nodemailer settings. Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and define the variables there.
5. Start the application by running the following command:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the Node.js server and make the application accessible locally.

## Deployment
To deploy the Node project to a production environment, follow these steps:

1. Choose a suitable hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean) and set up an account.
2. Configure the necessary environment variables in the hosting platform's settings or deployment configuration. Ensure you include all required variables defined in the `.env` file.
3. Set up a production-ready database if necessary, and update the connection details in the environment variables.
4. Upload the project files to the hosting platform, either by pushing the code to a remote repository or using the platform's deployment tools.
5. Install the project dependencies on the server by running:
   ```
   npm install --production
   ```
6. Start the application on the server by running:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   You may choose to use process managers like PM2 or Forever to keep the application running in the background.
